Terminate LocalHost


Open the CMD and type following.

netstat -aon | find "1099 (local host number)"

If a process uses above port, it should return something output like this.

TCP    xxx.xx.xx.xx:1099      xx.xx.xx.xxx:443      ESTABLISHED     2222
The last column value (2222) is referred to the Process ID (PID).

Kill localhost

taskkill /F /PID 2222

Now you can start your server.
